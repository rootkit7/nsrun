# Network namespace runner

Execute program in an existing network namespace.

**Warning:** This program needs elevated permissions to
do it's job. It also allows to join network namespaces
of other processes running as root and **maybe escape them
again**! It's not a tool to make your processes "secure"!

Make sure to understand the implications.

For most cases tools like firejail, nsenter and others may
be more capable.

For more information look into the [wiki](https://github.com/toke/nsrun/wiki)

## Why?

The main purpose of this tool is currently to run programs
within a different network namespace - for example a VPN
only namespace. This allows to contain the network traffic
for this program.


## Build
```
make
sudo chown root:nsrun nsrun
sudo chmod 4754 nsrun
```

Create a group nsrun and add yourself to group nsrun.


## Usage

Join a named network namespace:
```
NAMESPACE=/var/run/netns/mynamespace
./nsrun $NAMESPACE /usr/bin/bash -l
```

Join a namespace of another process

```
NAMESPACE=/proc/PID/ns/net
./nsrun $NAMESPACE /usr/bin/bash -l
```
